# ILSpy with X# Plugin Bundle

This repository provides a pre-configured ZIP package containing ILSpy 7 along with the X# plugin, ready to run out-of-the-box. This bundle is ideal for developers working with .NET assemblies and using X# as a language for decompilation and exploration.

## What Is This?

ILSpy is an open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler that helps developers inspect and understand compiled code. The X# plugin allows ILSpy to decompile .NET assemblies directly into X# code, making it a powerful tool for developers familiar with the X# language and those transitioning from Visual FoxPro.

## Key Features

- **Ready-to-Run Package**: No additional setup is needed; simply download, unzip, and run `ILSpy.exe`.
- **Integrated X# Decompilation**: View and decompile .NET assemblies directly into X#, facilitating learning and debugging.
- **Assembly Browsing**: Inspect dependencies, analyze code structure, and understand third-party libraries.
- **Cross-Language Understanding**: Helps bridge the gap between traditional .NET development and X# usage.

## How to Use

1. **Download** the ZIP package from this repository.
2. **Extract** the contents to your preferred directory.
3. **Run** `ILSpy.exe` to launch ILSpy with the X# plugin pre-configured.
4. **Load Assemblies** and begin exploring .NET code, decompiled into X# for better understanding and analysis.

## Use Cases

- **Code Review and Analysis**: Analyze how third-party libraries are implemented.
- **Learning X#**: Understand how .NET code translates into X# for educational purposes.
- **Debugging**: Inspect assemblies when source code is unavailable to find potential issues.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Examine compiled .NET code to identify logic and structure.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework (for running ILSpy).
- Basic familiarity with X# or Visual FoxPro is recommended for best results.
